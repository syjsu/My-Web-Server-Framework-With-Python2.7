Description: 
        *sqlcmd* is a SQL command line tool, similar in concept to tools like Oracle's
        `SQL*Plus`_, the PostgreSQL_ ``psql`` command, and MySQL_'s ``mysql`` tool.

        Some features at a glance
        --------------------------
        
        - Connection parameters for individual databases are kept in a configuration
          file in your home directory.
        - Databases can be assigned multiple logical names.
        - *sqlcmd* has command history management, with `GNU Readline`_ support.
          History files are saved per database.
        - *sqlcmd* supports SQL, but also supports database metadata (getting a list
          of tables, querying the table's columns and their data types, listing the
          indexes and foreign keys for a table, etc.).
        - *sqlcmd* supports Unix shell-style variables.
        - *sqlcmd* command has a ``.set`` command that displays and controls *sqlcmd*
          settings.
        - *sqlcmd* provides a standard interface that works the same no matter what
          database you're using.
        - *sqlcmd* uses the enhanced database drivers in the `Grizzled API`_'s ``db``
          module. (Those drivers are, in turn, built on top of standard Python
          DB API drivers like ``psycopg2`` and ``MySQLdb``.)
        - *sqlcmd* is written entirely in `Python`_, which makes it very portable
          (though the database drivers are often written in C and may not be available
          on all platforms).

        .. _Python: http://www.python.org/
        
        In short, *sqlcmd* is a SQL command tool that attempts to provide the same
        interface for all supported databases and across all platforms.
